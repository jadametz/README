# Questions for our first 1:1

These are my answers to questions that I'll ask in our first 1:1, and should be read as if my manager were asking them of me. They were derived from [Lara Hogan's article on the topic](http://larahogan.me/blog/first-one-on-one-questions/).

## Grumpiness

__What makes you grumpy?__

> Lack of trust. Repeated conversations/meetings.

__How will I know when you're grumpy?__

> I'll very likely tell you if something is up!

__How can I help you when you're grumpy?__

> Talking about something else is usually a good place to start.

## Feedback & Recognition

__How do you like feedback, the medium (IRC, email, in person, etc.)__

> Preferably in person for significant and/or career development related feedback. Slack is a great alternative for quick snippets. Use your best judgement.

__How do you like feedback, routine like in 1:1s, or as-it-happens__

> 1:1's are a great place for "trending" feedback, or things that happen on a recurring basis. As-it-happens can also be 1:1, but Slack is acceptable for quick snippets. Use your best judgement.

__How do you prefer to receive recognition? (public or private)__

> Public. It feels good. Private is good for reiterating specific points.

## Goals and Support

__What makes 1:1s the most valuable for you?__

> Anything but status/project updates. There's plenty of other (should be) deliberate time for that. If there's nothing else to talk about, I'd prefer to have my time back for other things.

__What are your goals for this year? And for the next 3 months?__

> This year I'm looking to settle into my role as an Engineering Manager. It's a new type of work so I'm confident there will be challenges and obstacles to overcome. Feeling _less unsure_ feels like a good 12 month goal. Over the next 3 I'm focusing on a smooth transition between managers for the team.

__What do you need from your manager?__

> Feedback, feedback, feedback. Someone to be a sounding board for ideas and potential solutions to problems. Preferably (not required) a mentor who has previously walked a similar path to what I'm walking.

__From your team?__

> Communication, early and often. We can't head off problems together if I don't know about them. 

__From your peers? (outside the team)__

> A network to lean on, similar to my manager, that isn't my manager.
