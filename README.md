# README

This is my personal _Management README_. It is living documentation about, me. Your feedback is welcome.

## My management philosophy

I believe in empowering teams to grow themselves. My role on the team is to make sure you have the skills, space, and context to do so.

Your time at `$COMPANY` is one stop along whatever career path you end up on. My goal is for you to get out of your time here more than you put in.

We hired you because you are smart and capable. I trust you to know your own limits and get support when needed. I may provide suggestions, but I will try to not force a solution. Everyone is different, and I realize some folks need more guidance than others. If you need more direction from me, __please let me know as soon as possible__.

## What I expect of you as your manager

The following are in order of importance:

1. **Be reliable**. If you tell myself or the team that you're going to do something, do it. Unless, you subsequently say you're not going to, and why.
2. **Ask questions**. I know you don't know.
3. **Ask for help**. I know you need it.
4. **Invest in self-improvement**. This looks different for everyone and can be going deeper, going broader, or engaging in feedback.

## What you can expect of me as your manager

An initital 1:1 where I'll ask a series of questions. My answers to which [are here](./First1on1.md).

A weekly (unless otherwise stated) 1:1, in which I provide context from the greater org, share any feedback I have for you (especially as it relates to career progression), and help you work through problems you’re trying to solve.

Routine sharing from me of the problems that I’m also facing in my current work, and concrete information about what I’m up to. _(Note: I could do better at this so please ask whenever you're curious!)_

Asynchronous responses if I’m in meetings. You can expect from me a response as soon as possible, even if that’s to set an expectation with you about when to expect an in-depth response from me. Your teammates are there to help as well if I'm unavailable.

The occassional late night or weekend Slack message. This is me working and does not mean you're required to outside of your normal working hours, unless otherwise stated due to the nature of our work. I will, in addition, always do my best to try and indicate priority as clearly as possible.

Encouraging and setting an example of a healthy work-life balance and avoiding burnout. I may from time to time ask for your help to make this possible!
